# How to contribute  

Contributions are welcome!  

Everything is done on GitHub, so please make sure that you have a GitHub account.  

## Use issues  

Use issues for everything, including enhancements and bugs.  

Please begin by reviewing the open issues to verify that one does not already exist for your intended contribution. If an issue already exists, please feel free to add on to it. If an issue doesn't already exist feel free to create one. Be sure to describe the contribution to be made, and apply appropriate labels. Use the issue template when appropriate.  

## Fork it  

Fork the repository, and from your fork create a topic branch. Do not work directly on the master branch. Try to name your topic branch after the bug fix or enhancement that you will be submitting.  

## Commits  

Make commits that include detailed messages.  

## Submitting  

Push your changes to your topic branch, and then submit a pull request to the original repository in the unblinking I/O organization. Reference the issue number in the pull request comments.  

## Follow-up  

If you haven't seen any activity from unblinking I/O on your pull request, or you have questions, feel free to email.
